You will be given a code snippet with comments. Your task is to fix any errors in the code and implement any unfinished functionality indicated in the comments. Only output valid code fragment in the provided language.

Here is the code snippet:

<code_snippet>
```{{current_buffer_filetype}}
{{visual_selection}}
```
</code_snippet>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully read through the entire code snippet, including all comments.

2. Identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or unimplemented functionality mentioned in the comments.

3. Fix all errors you've identified. This may include:
   - Correcting syntax mistakes
   - Addressing logical errors
   - Implementing missing functionality as described in the comments

4. Ensure that your changes maintain the original intent of the code while improving its functionality and correctness.

5. If there are multiple ways to implement a feature or fix an error, choose the most efficient and clear approach.

6. Do not add any new features or functionality beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the code or comments.

7. Maintain the original code style and formatting as much as possible, unless it directly contributes to the errors.

8. Keep any comments that were used to make changes.

9. If you make any significant changes or implementations, add brief comments on a separate line explaining your modifications.

Output your corrected and implemented code. Ensure that the code fragment you output is valid, and ready to run in the language of the original snippet.

Remember, only output valid code without any backticks. Do not include any explanations, notes, or anything other than the corrected code itself.
